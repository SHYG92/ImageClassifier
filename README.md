# ImageClassifier
This is my final project that I finished to get AI with Python NanoDegree from Misk-Udacity in December 2018. It's about programming an app for image classification purpose.

it has two parts:
Part 01: image classification app using Jupyter NoteBook.
Part 02: image classification app using Python with the command console.
